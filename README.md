# DynamicVisualAcuityExperiment
This repository contains the code to create a Landol C moving horizontally across the screen. We used this code to assess dynamic visual acuity. Please cite Palidis, Wyder-Hodge, Fooken, &amp; Spering, 2017 (https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0172061) to use this code.
The 2016 experiment (Palidis, D. J., Wyder-Hodge, P. A., Fooken, J., & Spering, M. (2017). Distinct eye movement patterns enhance dynamic visual acuity. PloS one, 12(2), e0172061.)
was run by running DVA_pursuit.m; this script uses a staircase method
We later added a version using constant stimuli rather than the staircase method; this is done in DVA_pursuit_constant_stimuli.m
